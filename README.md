This is a github for the codes used in my paper

"Comparing Accuracy of Ternary Neural Networks in Small Models"

How to use :
you need python 3.10 or later to use this project.
if you don't have poetry please install with
```
pip install poetry
```

after that
(I suggest you to change the folder name for filepath issue as I wrote)

```
git clone https://github.com/Snow0821/Comparing_Accuracy_of_Ternary_Neural_Networks_in_Small_Models.git catnn
poetry install
python test_code.py
```

You can find your results in the results folder
